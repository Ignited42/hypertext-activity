# Hypertext Activity
This is a repository for Exercise 6 of DTC 201, under Dr. Eliseo Ortiz. The point of this exercise is to create a HTML-CSS website that has at least 10 different pages to form an interactive narrative. It doesn't have to be strictly a narrative; as long as there are at least 10 different hyperlinks to different 10 different pages, it applies.

## Tools Used
- draw.io for diagramming the story
