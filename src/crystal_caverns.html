                Regardless of consequence, you trudged deeper. The ground slopes
                downward, taking you in the opposite direction of your original
                destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                You feel your way forward, hands outstretched to navigate around
                obstacles that would gladly smack you in the face. You take careful
                steps, not wanting to fall into a ditch or a hole.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is only after some time that you notice your surroundings begin
                to brighten. Dimly at first, but now you could finally see the shape
                of your hands!
            </p>
            <p>
                You run forward, as small crystals illuminate your path. There's no
                turning back now.
