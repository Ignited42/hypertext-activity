                The closer you get to the source of the music, the louder it
                becomes. You can hear the cymbals crashing, feet stomping to
                a rhythm. A symphony of springs plucked against an army of
                brass.
            </p>
            <p>
                A winding note, a long sigh. An outward spiral, a glass sky.
            </p>
            <p>
                You shake your head, dispelling the reverie and mesmerizing
                song. In the distance, you see a group of figures where the
                the music seems to emanate from. They're too far to make out
                any details, except for that they're wearing black.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's tempting to follow them, to let yourself be entranced
                by the music. To dance along with them to locales unknown.
                The question is, will you?
