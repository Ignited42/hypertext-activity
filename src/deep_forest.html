                It's dark. You've ventured deeper and it's getting harder and
                harder to see what lies ahead. If it's not the thick branches
                or tall foliage that obscures your vision, it's the lack of
                sunlight penetrating through the canopy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't good. You're getting lost. You've had to whirl around
                to get yourself unstuck several times already. Yet all you see are
                wide trunks of wood. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You hear another rustle. But you're not sure from where. The wind
                has long since died down. You could feel something staring at the
                back of your head.
