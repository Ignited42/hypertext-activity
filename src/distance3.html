                Your strides are purposeful, relaxed as you make the journey up. Hours have passed,
                but it doesn't look like you've made any progress to your destination. The house is
                just as far as it was before.
            </p>
            <p>
                You continue your relentless pace, yet find yourself beginning to slow down. At some
                point, you don't remember when, the path begins to slope up. Every mile you walk,
                your steps become more laborious than before. You heave and puff breaths of air,
                heated from the exertion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet you continue to walk, as if in a dream, time slips by over and over. Until you
                find yourself at the bottom of a mountain. Its massive stone walls stretch high above,
                blocking your way forward. To the right, you spot crevice, a depression in the jagged
                rocks.
