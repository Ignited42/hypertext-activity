                You walk along the sandy shores, feeling the soft sand between your toes.
                You remember the feeling of diving into cool waters on a hot sunny day.
                Even with no sun, you can still feel the heat linger on your skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                You consider taking a dip into the shallow waves, wanting to relive the
                experience once more. But getting wet here feels wrong somehow. So you
                settle by standing on the edge, where waves wash against the soles of
                your feet, barely reaching your ankles.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that little distraction, you notice a forest just a few feet inland
                from the shore. Another trip down the winding dirt path wouldn't hurt,
                right?
            </p>
