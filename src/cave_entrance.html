                You investigate the crevice, finding that it leads you to the mouth of
                a cave. The air here is damp and cool, no doubt it means that there's
                airflow inside of the cave.
            </p>
            <p>
                You take a few experimental steps, only to see darkness all around.
                You look back and can still see the entrance, but it's too dark to
                make anything out, let alone explore the cave.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is it even worth exploring? For all you know there's nothing to be
                found here. After all, this wasn't the point of your journey, was it?
