            <p>It begins with a dream.</p>
            <p>What did you dream?</p>
            <p>Did you laugh? Did you fight?</p>
            <p>Did you fly? Did you cry?</p>

            <p style="padding: 15px 15px;">It doesn't matter.</p>

            <p>You are bound to wake up after some time.</p>
            <p>It's a dream after all.</p>
            <p>No matter how beautiful it is,</p>
            <p>you need to wake up.</p>

            <p style="padding: 15px 15px;">And so you fall.</p>

            <p>Fall into the dark depths below.</p>
            <p>Falling to a place you know very well.</p>
            <p>Falling back to where you came from.</p>

            <p style="padding: 15px 15px;">Are you scared?</p>

            <p>Reality isn't always kind,</p>
            <p>and it has been especially cruel to you.</p>
            <p>But it's okay, because it'll be different now.</p>
            <p>I'll be with you. Always.</p>

            <p style="padding-top: 50px; text-align:center; font-weight: bold;">I love you.</p>
