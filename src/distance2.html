                You walked on the dirt path leading to a nearby town. Its buildings were a glamorous white,
                reminding you more of porcelain or ivory than stone. The wells overflow with fresh spring water,
                pooling and feeding into a nearby fountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The town is beautiful, almost unrealistically so. Its flower gardens, the hanging trees and
                flags, the whimsical roads and paths. And yet there's not a person in sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is only once you reach the town square that you could hear the sound of pipes and drums.
                A parade. However, in the opposite direction lies your destination: the house on the hill.
