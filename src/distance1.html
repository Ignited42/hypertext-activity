                The dirt churns under your feet, small stones left on the wayside clattering
                as you move across the stony beach. Soon, those small stones turn to gravel
                and the sound of your footsteps are dampened by the soft, warm sand.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can hear the waves gently lap against the shore, memories of seabirds
                squawking fill in the silence around you.
