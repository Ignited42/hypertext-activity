                There's no other way to go about it, other than to move forward. So you scramble
                for handholds as your feet find a stable position. And you begin to climb.
            </p>
            <p>
                You climb and climb. Sometimes it's a straight hike, other times it's a precarious
                drop. A few times you fall. But you get up. And keep climbing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After an indeterminate amount of time, the treacherous winds began to die down and
                the path seemed to be clearer than ever. Once your feet began to step on the flat,
                stable stones, you can see it up ahead.

                It's so out of place for something that looks so normal. The tiled roofs, the
                small windows, the narrow porch.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's only one thing left to do.
