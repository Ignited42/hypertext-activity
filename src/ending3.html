                The next thing you know, you've burst into a most wondrous sight.
                Small crystals line the walls and ceilings of the open-air cavern.
                Lights glitter and bounce around as miniscule drops of water pool
                and form streams.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not even mentioning the many flora and fauna: strange,
                undiscovered and thriving in this underground paradise!
            </p>
            <p>
                This thrilling discovery does come at a cost; you can't go back.
                Not even the crystals here are bright enough to illuminate the
                darkness you've came from.
            </p>
            <p>
                So you carry on, with a spring in your step, as you venture forward
                on a new adventure unlike anything anyone's ever seen.
