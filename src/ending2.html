                It's here. Everyone's here! Faces you recognize, faces you've forgotten,
                faces you've never met before. They are smiling, laughing with glee as
                the music drowns out everything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your sorrows, your guilt, for a moment, you could finally slip away from
                it all and dance to your heart's content. The parade marches on and you
                march with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                You stomp at every beat and clap on every note. Every song you sing
                is shared by hundreds of others. And so you march until the sun sets in
                the distant skies.
