                The forest is bright and rife with life. You could hear the birds
                chirping as they flew from branch to branch. Insects buzz busily
                as they go about their short noisy lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                You hear rustling from ahead, a small animal must've been disturbed
                and is retreating away. Either that or it's the cool wind that's
                bringing relief to your sun-drenched skin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The forest is idyllic, peaceful. Perfect for your afternoon walk.
                If only you could stay here forever.
            </p>
